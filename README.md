# BasicPyCalculator

A simple calculator developed using Python. TKinter was used for the GUI to create an easier user 
interface rather than using the pyhton command line interface.

The code uses three basic functions (add, evaluate, clear) and these are passed when the buttons are pressed within the GUI.
